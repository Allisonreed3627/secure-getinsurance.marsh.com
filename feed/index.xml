<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween Party officially kicks off in just one week! This special event is <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/the-best-experiences-currently-available-at-walt-disney-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the best experiences</a> Walt Disney World has to offer. Not surprisingly, that makes it extremely popular. Guests love dressing up in costume (usually against the rules) and trick-or-treating through the Magic Kingdom! Throw in a <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disneyparkslive-to-live-stream-boo-to-you-halloween-parade-at-walt-disney-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special parade</a>, exciting stage show featuring the <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/did-you-know-the-sanderson-sisters-were-based-on-real-people-jb1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanderson Sisters</a> and exclusive fireworks show and you can see why guests get very excited about Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween Party. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the event completely sold out for the very first time in nearly two decades! This year, though, things are looking much slower for the extra-cost event. Tickets have been on sale for months and so far only 6 dates have sold out. That’s unexpected. Even more unexpected,  the first night is still available.  By this time last year, it was sold out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of sold out dates is surprising. Disneyland’s <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/oogie-boogie-bash-sold-out-jb1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oogie Boogie Bash sold out completely </a>in one day. This is good news for guests going to the event because it means that the event will likely be less crowded than previous years. It also means if you haven’t gotten your tickets yet, you’re in luck– there’s definitely still time. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_178125" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178125" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-178125" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=" http:="" alt="mickey's not so scary halloween party 2023 sold out tickets family cinderella castle magic kingdom disney world halloween costumes" width="1200" height="600" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam.jpg 1200w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam-50x25.jpg 50w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-lazy-src="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam.jpg"/><noscript><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178125" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-178125" src="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam.jpg" alt="mickey's not so scary halloween party 2023 sold out tickets family cinderella castle magic kingdom disney world halloween costumes" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam.jpg 1200w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fam-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"/></noscript></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Halloween night is predictably sold out. Opening night is surprisingly still available though! Usually the first night is among the first to sell out. So far 1 night in October (October 31), 1 night in September  (September 15), and 4 nights in August (August 15, 18, 22, 25) have sold out. That still leaves 3 nights in August, 12 nights in September, a whooping 17 nights in October and November’s only date (November 1) are all still available.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t predict this event will completely sell out like it did last year. Last year’s popularity was mostly due to pent up demand from COVID and 2020 and 2021’s Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween Party cancellations. However, if you plan to go, don’t delay in getting your tickets. While we don’t expect the event to be a complete sell out, more dates will certainly become unavailable as we near <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/yes-august-is-too-early-to-celebrate-halloween-at-disney-world-ma1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Halloween season. </a></span>Get your tickets <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/events/mickeys-not-so-scary-halloween-party/purchase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Johnny Depp is a legendary character actor and became a household name as the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow. His career has spanned decades and includes an incredibly diverse range of roles from horror to musicals and everything in between! <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/johnny-depp-film-co-starring-dwayne-johnson-could-save-disney-lf1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The versatile actor </a>has been Edward Scissorhands, Sweeny Todd, Gellert Grindelwald, The Lone Ranger, Willy Winka, the Mad Hatter…even Donald Trump! Still, when you say Johnny Depp, it is Jack Sparrow that comes to mind.</p>
<div id="attachment_186225" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><noscript><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186225" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-186225" src="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Adobe_Express_20230803_0810500_1.png" alt="Johnny depp pirate" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Adobe_Express_20230803_0810500_1.png 1200w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Adobe_Express_20230803_0810500_1-300x150.png 300w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Adobe_Express_20230803_0810500_1-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Adobe_Express_20230803_0810500_1-768x384.png 768w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Adobe_Express_20230803_0810500_1-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"/></noscript></p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition to one of the main driving forces behind the massive popularity of the <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/without-johnny-depp-future-of-disney-pirates-of-the-caribbean-ma1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em></a> film franchise, Jack Sparrow is also Depp’s most reprised role. Depp has graced the silver screen as Captain Jack Sparrow five times over the course of two-decades. It’s no wonder that he became as attached to the character as fans were. Two decades after the first film’s release, Jack Sparrow remains one of the most well-developed, well-written anti-heroes in film history.</p>
<p>Playing the iconic character took a toll on Depp. After two decades as Jack Sparrow, he grew to appreciate the character on a very personal level. “It’s very strange. I’m not real spooky about that whole, ‘You become the character,’ that’s not it at all, ” Depp said. “Just, knowing someone so well and having played them, having them be second nature, it just happens naturally. It’s very foreign to the body to stop doing it.”</p>

<p>He says that after he wrapped filming for the final time, he fell into a deep depression at the thought of never being Captain Jack Sparrow again. “I really loved being the character so much so that at the end of the film, when they wrapped the end of the film — and this has happened to me before — you go through a sort of a decompression, and a depression where you feel like, ‘God, I’ve just been this other guy for six months or seven months. I’ll never see him again,’” he said.</p>
<p>While Depp was in the throes of depression and coming to terms with Jack Sparrow’s story being over, <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/after-johnny-depps-court-victory-washington-post-adds-editors-note-to-amber-heard-oped-ks1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his ex-wife, Amber Heard, accused him of abuse.</a> What followed was a brutal trail on the court of public opinion. He was presumed guilty and quickly dropped from projects. He and Disney had a tumultuous falling out that left Depp feeling alone and betrayed after Disney severed ties with him just four days after Amber Heard accused him of domestic violence. The defamation trial against Heard that followed was highly publicized and though Depp won, Disney <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/johnny-depp-pirates-5-ending-bb1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t backtrack on their ousting</a> of the vindicated actor.</p>

<p>Though rumors swirl that the actor will reprise his role as the iconic pirate, he remains adamant that <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/johnny-depp-says-he-wont-return-to-disneys-pirates-of-the-caribbean-films-bb1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he will not</a>. He’s even gone so far as to say he’d turn down $20 million for the part. He has grieved the loss of his relationship with Disney and has mourned the end of Captain Jack Sparrow. His parting words as the character are a fitting send off for the beloved captain, “I have a rendezvous beyond my beloved horizon.”</p>

<p>The crowds at<a href="https://www.disneydining.com/"> Disney World</a> create an enchanting and bustling atmosphere that is both exhilarating and overwhelming. As one of the most popular and iconic theme park destinations in the world, Disney World attracts<a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-world-current-crowd-level-has-little-to-do-with-desantis-and-florida-politics-ma1/"> Guests</a> from all walks of life, creating a diverse and vibrant gathering of people. The sheer volume of visitors can often give the Park a sense of constant motion and excitement, but it also presents some challenges and considerations for those navigating through the sea of people.</p>
<p>Walt Disney World is home to four theme parks, <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/the-ultimate-list-of-food-you-cant-miss-in-the-magic-kingdom-ck1/">Magic Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-world-announces-a-brand-new-restaurant-coming-to-epcot-bb1/">EPCOT</a>, <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disneys-animal-kingdom-welcomes-adorable-new-addition-ir1/">Disney’s Animal Kingdom</a>, and <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-after-hours-at-hollywood-studios-sells-out-indefinitely-em1/">Disney’s Hollywood Studios.</a> Each Disney Park includes magical character meet and greets, thrilling attractions, amazing dining options, and much more. Walt Disney World Resort sees thousands of Guests daily with this amount of traffic heading to Disney Parks, Guests planning their trips tend to look for certain times when Disney is experiencing lower crowds.</p>
<div id="attachment_185211" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/he-2023-07-26T122531.241.jpg"></a></p>

</div>
<p>During <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/massive-crowds-guarenteed-for-this-week-em1/">peak seasons</a> and holidays, the <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/walt-disney-world-is-barren-no-guests-to-be-found-em1/">crowds</a> at Disney World can reach staggering numbers, resulting in long lines, crowded walkways, and packed attractions. The main hubs, such as <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/cinderellas-royal-table-breakfast-an-honest-review-january-2022-cg1/">Cinderella Castle</a> at Magic Kingdom or <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disneys-epcot-welcoming-new-rides-in-world-pavilion-heres-what-we-know-ir1/">World Showcase</a> at <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney100-celebration-at-epcot-disney-world-bb1/">EPCOT</a>, can become particularly congested as Guests gather to watch parades, fireworks, and entertainment shows. The energy of the crowd is contagious, as the collective enthusiasm of visitors creates an infectious atmosphere of joy and wonder.</p>
<p>Navigating through the <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/impossible-reservations-available-as-crowds-are-nowhere-to-be-found-jb1/">crowds</a> requires a combination of patience, strategy, and flexibility. Disney World has implemented various crowd management techniques to help streamline the Guests experience, including advanced reservations for dining and attractions, virtual queues for popular rides, and <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-announces-major-change-to-genie-service-that-will-drastically-improve-guest-experience-em1/">Genie + system</a> and <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/the-complete-guide-to-disney-genie-and-lightning-lane-ck1mmb/">Lighting Lane</a> that allow Guests to reserve access to select attractions in advance.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges posed by <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/top-ten-tips-peak-days/">large crowds,</a> there is a unique camaraderie that forms among Guests. People from all around the world come together to share in the magic of Disney, bonding over their common love for beloved characters, enchanting stories, and the thrill of experiencing the Park’s attractions. Families, friends, and solo travelers alike can be seen interacting, laughing, and sharing memorable moments throughout <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/best-off-peak-weeks-to-visit-walt-disney-world/">Disney Parks.</a></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15hmthc/empty_parks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1">social media post,</a> One Guest commented about the number of people at the Parks. The wait time at Disney Parks can show how many Guests they are seeing. This Guest waited 30 minutes for <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-remys-ratatouille-adventure-cg1/">Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure</a> in the rain. They also waited over an hour for Space Mountain, even during one of the fireworks shows. Another thing this Guest talks about is that <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/tron-lightcycle-run-officially-open-ir1/">TRON Lightcycle/Run</a> sold out first thing in the morning in about three seconds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We just got back–we waited an hour and 30 minutes for Remy, in the rain on a Tuesday. Waited an hour and 10 minutes for Space Mountain during the evening fireworks. Tron sold out at 7am in approx 3.5 seconds. The parks are not empty.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disney World is a place where Guests can make memories that will last a lifetime. The Wonder of magic comes alive, and Guests can immerse themself in the different Parks. While Disney crowds can be large, the magic is still there and Guests can still have a great experience even at Disney’s busier times.</p>

<p>Fans across the globe travel to Disney Parks to have a magical time. The same can be said of excited audiences streaming Disney+ or taking the time to go to the movie theater for a new Disney release. What was <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-pixar-lost-its-magic-animation-reign-ends-lf1/">once a trusted entity</a> in warm, uplifting, quality content has turned into something that fans can’t seem to escape from. Back to back to back announcements about Disney’s live action remakes of beloved films has fans accusing the company of smothering them.</p>
<div id="attachment_186614" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-7.jpg"><noscript><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186614" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-186614" src="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-7.jpg" alt="disney's live action remakes smothering disney fan halle bailey little mermaid emma watson walt disney pictures animated film remake peter pan" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-7.jpg 1200w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-7-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-7-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-7-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-7-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"/></noscript></a></p>

<p>The list of every upcoming live action remake is truly suffocating, with new announcements happening only hours apart. Most recently, fans were notified that both <i>Tangled </i>and <i>The Princess and the Frog</i> were next on the docket. Here’s the current list as of now:</p>
<p>That list doesn’t even include all planned sequels or movies in the <a href="https://screenrant.com/disney-upcoming-movies-live-action-animation-remakes/#jungle-book-2---in-development">pre-development</a> stages. This is also on the heels of <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/the-real-reason-the-little-mermaid-is-floundering-jb1/"><i>The Little Mermaid </i></a>remake starring Halle Bailey and <i><a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-scheduling-error-doomed-haunted-mansion-film-lf1/">Haunted Mansion</a>, </i>both of which underperformed in theaters. AND Disney+’s <i><a href="https://www.disneydining.com/growing-up-wrong-an-honest-peter-pan-wendy-review-lf1/">Peter Pan &amp; Wendy</a>!</i> Fans barely have a second to come up for air.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let us breath I&#8217;m beggin <a href="https://t.co/5cNbPdq6Ot">pic.twitter.com/5cNbPdq6Ot</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Disney’s live action remakes must be making some kind of money but retold Disney Princess stories with big names like Emma Watson don’t seem to be what fans are asking for. Does Walt Disney Studios plan to remake its entire <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-adds-more-content-warnings-on-its-classic-films-bb1/">catalog of animated films</a>?</p>
<p>Also, how is Disney able to keep releasing these announcements during <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-shuts-down-multiple-movies-amid-hollywood-strike-bwb1/">the entertainment labor strikes</a> that have pretty much shut down Hollywood? Personally, I don’t think artificial intelligence is going to be able to save the Disney remake trend. Fans are already tired of it!</p>

<p>Disney’s live action remakes <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-is-hiring-ai-alternatives-as-writers-strike-continues-on-em1/">reveal the machinery</a> behind a company that built its brand on empathy, humanity, and wholesomeness.

<p>Will fans’ alienation translate at the box office? Or can all the social media complaints just be written off?</p>

<p>Marvel fans mourning the end of the <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/30-thoughts-i-had-while-watching-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-lf1/"><i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> film saga</a> can find joy again in Disney Plus’ <i>I Am Groot</i> season two! Referred to as “<a href="https://www.disneydining.com/select-guests-test-groundbreaking-baby-groot-animatronic-at-disneyland-lf1/">Marvel’s Sweetest Hero</a>,” Baby Groot takes center stage in this Disney streaming series that premiered in August 2022 and gained immediate fan love. Now, Marvel Studios has announced the highly anticipated season two of <i>I Am Groot</i> will premiere on September 6th!</p>
<p>Here are the details…</p>
<div id="attachment_186620" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-11-1.jpg"><noscript><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186620" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-186620" src="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-11-1.jpg" alt="i am groot season two disney plus baby groot tv series september 6th marvel cinematic universe official trailer" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-11-1.jpg 1200w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-11-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-11-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-11-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ret-invasion-11-1-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"/></noscript></a></p>

<p>Just like season one, <i>I Am Groot </i>season two will feature five never before seen animated shorts following <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/too-cute-a-baby-groot-inspired-cookie-recipe/">Baby Groot’s adventures</a> across the galaxy. In addition to starring “everyone’s favorite little tree,” fans got to meet “several new and unusual characters” throughout the Disney series. Season two of the Kirsten Lepore-created TV series promises the same space escapades but could possibly be <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/baby-groot-cupcakes-now-available-at-walt-disney-world/">even CUTER this time</a> around.</p>
<p>In the official trailer for <i>I Am Groot </i>season two, we see the <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/video-popular-disney-character-shocks-guests-while-narrowly-avoiding-injury/">adorable little guy</a> playing with an action figure and a soup can (which seem to fall in love?), pining over some galactic ice cream ship, fogging up a window in the shape of a heart, and it only gets bigger from there.</p>

<p>Baby Groot presumably continues visiting various planets across the galaxy. Audiences can enjoy watching him in a snowball fight, enjoying some marshmallows, floundering in an <i>Indiana Jones-</i>style adventure, and even learning what it’s like to have a functioning nose.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of all the tree puns, <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/theres-a-secret-marvel-script-only-vin-diesel-can-lay-eyes-on-lf1/">Marvel Entertainment</a> posted, “You woodn’t beleaf what Groot gets up to in Season 2!” Check out the official trailer below!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

</blockquote>
<p>Marvel especially saved this announcement for the first Sunday in August, also known as National Tree Day. So cute.</p>
<p>Will you be tuning in to see Baby Groot in action? It’s definitely a great way to ease your <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/fans-all-say-the-same-thing-about-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-no-spoilers-lf1/"><i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 </i></a>withdrawal.</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO — An hours-long SWAT standoff that caused Friday morning road closures in Carlsbad has ended.</p>
<p>A man with armed with a hand gun was reportedly experiencing a mental health crisis inside his vehicle on the 2700 block of Loker Avenue West, near Palomar Airport Road, the Carlsbad Police Department confirmed.</p>

</div>
<p>The situation initially started around 7:15 p.m. Thursday following reports of an individual in distress in an office building parking lot on Loker Avenue West, according to police.</p>
<p>Authorities say the man activated the vehicle’s emergency communication system — similar to  OnStar — Thursday evening.</p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>Carlsbad police told FOX 5 it was challenging to communicate with the man through the third-party OnStar system due to a language barrier. </p>
<p>Police temporarily closed Loker Avenue West from Palomar Airport Road to El Fuerte Street while officers responded to the situation. Crisis negotiators were also called to the scene and police say someone who speaks the man’s language also assisted throughout the standoff.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab">
</aside>
<p>Businesses on Loker Avenue West from Palomar Airport Road to 2762 Loker Avenue West were also temporarily closed “out of an abundance of caution,” police said.</p>
<p>Those arriving to work in the area where seen being turned away by authorities. It appeared public transportation was also been affected. A BREEZE bus was seen at a standstill around 7 a.m. </p>
<p>Authorities say there no current threat to public and the SWAT standoff “has been resolved peacefully.”</p>
<p>All roads in the area have have since reopened.</p>

<p>The Mexico-based restaurant, known as In-I-Nout, serves grilled topped burgers and fries, along with a special sauce, all served on a red tray, just like In-N-Out restaurants in the U.S.</p>

<p>A video of the restaurant made its rounds on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_romabeltran91/video/7256658980666100997?_r=1&amp;_t=8eZ2HLlj0X4" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@_romabeltran91/video/7256658980666100997?_r=1&amp;_t=8eZ2HLlj0X4" target="_blank">TikTok </a>in early July and has garnered about 1 million views and more than 53,000 likes.</p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>However, In-N-Out doesn’t seem too happy with the surprise pop-up restaurant, telling KTLA that they are unable to comment “due to ongoing litigation,” signaling that the restaurant is pursuing legal action against the copycat.</p>
<p>In-N-Out Burger opened in 1948 as a tiny stand at Francisquito and Garvey avenues in Baldwin Park. Harry and Esther Snyder, the company’s founders, are credited with inventing the world’s first drive-thru with a two-way speaker box that same year.</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO — Attention Barbie fans: a new Dreamhouse-themed pop-up is headed to San Diego next week.</p>
<p>The Barbie Truck Dreamhouse Living Tour is set to roll into America’s Finest City in hot-pink style, with a stop at Westfield UTC on Saturday, Aug. 12.</p>
<p>The Barbie Truck Tour set back on the road earlier this year with an all-new look to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the doll’s moving into her original Dreamhouse, a cardboard ranch-style house reminiscent of a 1962 college student’s pad.</p>
<p>This year’s Dreamhouse Living Tour is channeling the flower power of the decade, along with the quintessential hyper-pink Malibu aesthetic that has become synonymous with the Barbie brand.</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO — A motorcyclist was injured Friday night after colliding with a vehicle in the Ridgeview/Webster neighborhood, authorities said.</p>
<p>According to the San Diego Police Department, collision occurred in the 4500 block of Home Ave. around 10:18 p.m.</p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>Authorities say a 46-year-old woman was stopped in the bike lane facing east along the south curb in a 2011 Hyundai Tucson. At that same time, a 25-year-old man was traveling eastbound while riding a 2017 Yamaha motorcycle.</p>

<p>The Hyundai reportedly made a U-turn from the bike lane directly into the path of the motorcycle, according to SDPD. The motorcyclist struck the Hyundai on the driver’s side front fender as a result.</p>
<p>Police say the rider was transported to the hospital with multiple fractures and a laceration to his ankle. His injuries are considered non-life threatening.</p>
