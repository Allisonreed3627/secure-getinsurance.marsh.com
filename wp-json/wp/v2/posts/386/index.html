The film, based loosely on the popular Disneyland and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/guest-falls-to-their-death-at-contemporary-resort-in-walt-disney-world-ma1\/\">Walt Disney World<\/a>, was produced by Jeremy Bruckheimer and featured one of Hollywood\u2019s hottest names. The world changed as the handsome and slightly villainous Captain Jack Sparrow sprang to life, immediately becoming a Disney icon. Alongside other talented names like Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, and Jeffrey Rush, \u201cPirate-Fever\u201d eventually set in. Captain Jack Sparrow quickly became one of the most recognizable characters ever, leading a franchise grossing over $ 4 billion globally.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Although Depp is the centerpiece of\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pirates of the Caribbean<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, Among the rest of the star-studded cast was a name that could only be found deep into the credits. Although she\u2019s not longer at the bottom of the totem pole, you may have forgotten that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/audiences-totally-missed-this-risque-detail-in-avatar-the-way-of-water-ir1\/\">Zoe Saldana<\/a> had a brief on-screen role in the first-ever Pirates film. Cast as Anamaria, Saldana plays alongside Depp as Jack Sparrow attempts to put together a crew of his own. Although not said outright, it is heavily implied that Saldana\u2019s character has had plenty of \u201cintermingling\u201d with the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow, and their past has left her weary of working with him again. The short speaking part was a highlight in the film as it provided a new and exciting character in Anamaria and delivered a promiscuous back story to the seemingly family-friendly pirate captain.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Johnny Depp and Pirate\u2019s 6<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_178651\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-178651\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-178651\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"Source Close to Johnny Depp Hints at His Return to DisneySource Close to Johnny Depp Hints at His Return to Disney\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns.png 1200w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns-1024x512.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns-768x384.png 768w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns-50x25.png 50w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-178651\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-178651\" src=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns.png\" alt=\"Source Close to Johnny Depp Hints at His Return to DisneySource Close to Johnny Depp Hints at His Return to Disney\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns.png 1200w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns-1024x512.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns-768x384.png 768w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/jack-sparrow-returns-50x25.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-178651\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: Disney\/ Canva<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As Johnny Depp continues to deal with personal issue after personal issue, the most recent being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marca.com\/en\/lifestyle\/celebrities\/2023\/07\/26\/64c0e2f746163fa7088b456d.html\">found passed out in a hotel room<\/a> overseas, the reality of a continuation of the\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pirates of the Caribbean<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> films led by Jack Sparrow becomes less likely.

This has led many to consider a replacement for the big-time actor, and some who remember Saldana from the first film have suggested that her character could be a starting place for a fresh story to carry on the franchise. The consideration makes sense as Depp, now 60, has noticeably lost a step or two as Jack Sparrow in the last two films. Replacing the good captain with a character who\u2019s already appeared in the movies could work considering Saldana (unlike then) now has plenty of experience bringing solid female leads to the screen.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Zoe Saldana and Pirate\u2019s 6<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_185324\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-185324\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-185324 size-full\" title=\"zoe saldana johnny depp pirates of the caribbean\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"zoe saldana johnny depp pirates of the caribbean\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean.png 1200w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean-1024x512.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean-768x384.png 768w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean-50x25.png 50w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean.png\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-185324\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-185324 size-full\" title=\"zoe saldana johnny depp pirates of the caribbean\" src=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean.png\" alt=\"zoe saldana johnny depp pirates of the caribbean\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean.png 1200w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean-1024x512.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean-768x384.png 768w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/anamaria-johnny-depp-pirates-of-the-caribbean-50x25.png 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-185324\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: Disney<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This seems like a good idea at first, as Saldana has grown into a big name herself with titles credited to her, such as James Cameron\u2019s\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Avatar <\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">(2009)<\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0and Marvel\u2019s\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Guardians of the Galaxy <\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">(2014).<\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> As Saldana has experience with high-grossing films like <\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Avengers: Infinity War <\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">(2018)<\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, taking the helm of the\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Pirates of the Caribbean<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0franchise (or at least returning) shouldn\u2019t seem like an issue.

It\u2019s a rather sad commentary as bringing a past character to the forfront of the series could breath fresh life and rejuvenate the hugely successful franchise. However, Saldana is adamant that her experience alongside actors and producers like Johnny Depp in the first film has left her sure she is interested in returning. As she\u2019s not hurting for work and continues to pop in for significant screentime in exceptionally popular Marvel projects and Avatar films, she can afford to be picky about her roles. Currently, Saldana is associated with the top <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boxofficemojo.com\/chart\/top_lifetime_gross\/?area=XWW\">three-grossing films<\/a> OF ALL TIME!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Although not typically a name that comes to mind when we consider \u201cstar power,\u201d Saldana has proven time and time again to be a positive correlation with massively successful film projects. Although <a href=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/disney-removes-main-character-from-attraction-bwb1\/\">Pirates of the Caribbean<\/a> fans wish to see Johnny Depp back as Jack Sparrow, even if he and Disney came to an agreement, the character had become stale in the last two films. For Pirates to continue, it needs new blood, and Zoe Saldana\u2019s track record proves it would be a successful venture with her at the helm.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_178843\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-178843\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-178843\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"johnny depp pirates of the caribbean abandoned movie set disney Wallilabou Anchorage\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31-768x384.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31-50x25.jpg 50w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31.jpg\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-178843\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-178843\" src=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31.jpg\" alt=\"johnny depp pirates of the caribbean abandoned movie set disney Wallilabou Anchorage\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31-768x384.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Untitled-design-31-50x25.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-178843\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: David Firth\/ Flickr<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Currently, Saldana is hard at work bringing <em>Avatar 3<\/em> to life.
