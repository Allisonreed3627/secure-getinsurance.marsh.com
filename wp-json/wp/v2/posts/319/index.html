These events are rare among young people, but they are not as rare among young athletes as some might think, Drezner said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBronny represents the single highest athlete risk group\u201d for sudden cardiac arrest, Drezner said.<\/p>\n<p>Drezner\u2019s research on sudden cardiac arrest among young athletes shows that young, Black male, NCAA athletes who play Division I basketball have a 1 in 2,000 chance of experiencing sudden cardiac arrest each year. The risk in a male, White Division I basketball player is 1 in 5,000, according to his research.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAdolescent male basketball players and college male basketball players, for reasons that we don\u2019t fully understand, are by far our single highest risk group of athletes for sudden cardiac arrest,\u201d said Drezner. \u201cIn my opinion, they should all be screened with more robust and intensive cardiac screening than occurs typically.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bronny James <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2023\/07\/26\/sport\/bronny-james-cardiac-arrest-screening\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had a cardiac screening several months ago<\/a> as part of a program for prospective NBA players, according to a source familiar with the matter.<\/p>\n<p>The screening included a transthoracic echocardiogram, which looks at blood flow through the heart and heart valves, and EKG, which is a recording of the heart\u2019s electrical activity, the source said, and both screenings came back with normal results.<\/p>\n<h2>Testing helps inform next steps<\/h2>\n<p>Sudden cardiac arrest can be fatal if not immediately treated, but it can be reversed by CPR and shocks from a defibrillator, according to the American Heart Association.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPrompt rescussitation is the first, and major, major step, in terms of predicting long term recovery,\u201d Dr. Charles R. Hattemer, told CNN Wednesday. Hattemer is chief of cardiology at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, the team that treated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2023\/07\/13\/sport\/damar-hamlin-espy-awards-bills-tribute\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Damar Hamlin of the NFL\u2019s Buffalo Bills after his high-profile cardiac arrest<\/a> during a game earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>More than 70% of cardiac arrests that happen outside of a hospital occur in homes or private residences, according to the American Heart Association. They say training community members in how to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or use an automated external defibrillator (AED) can save lives.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe on-site medical team rapidly evaluated the situation and appeared to respond quickly by immediately starting CPR and reportedly using a closely located AED,\u201d the American Heart Association said in a statement on James\u2019 condition.<\/p>\n<p>Once a person has received immediate medical treatment and is stabilized, the next step is for doctors to perform testing to understand why the sudden cardiac arrest occurred.<\/p>\n<p>Drezner said that doctors will likely perform a comprehensive evaluation on James to determine the cause of his cardiac arrest. That will help inform a management plan for his health going forward.<\/p>\n<p>Many young athletes in James\u2019 situation would receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), a small device placed in the chest to detect and stop irregular heartbeats.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf they ever go into another potentially lethal arrhythmia, that defibrillator is super effective at shocking them immediately and returning their heart to a normal rhythm,\u201d Drezner said.<\/p>\n<h2>\u2018There should be AEDs everywhere\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>Recovery from cardiac arrest can look different for each person.<\/p>\n<p>Research on sudden deaths of NCAA student athletes between 2004 and 2008 showed cardiovascular-related sudden death was the leading cause of death in 45 cases, about nine each year, according to a 2011 study.<\/p>\n<p>For young athletes like James, having trained staff and an AED on site can boost the survival rate for sudden cardiac arrest to over 80%, Drezner said.<\/p>\n<p>Last July, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2023\/07\/26\/another-usc-basketball-player-had-cardiac-arrest-at-practice-a-year-ago-heres-what-happened\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USC freshman forward Vince Iwuchukwu suffered a cardiac arrest<\/a> during a summer workout. He received CPR from athletic trainers on site, who shocked him back to life. Over six months after the incident, Iwuchukwu recovered and returned to play in a game.<\/p>\n<p>In January, Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest after making a tackle and appearing to be hit by a helmet against his chest during a Monday Night Football game. Hamlin lost his pulse on the field and needed to be revived through resuscitation and defibrillation. He was hospitalized for over a week.<\/p>\n<p>Hamlin said his cardiac arrest was caused by commotio cordis, when severe trauma to the chest disrupts the heart\u2019s electrical charge and causes dangerous fibrillations. He has been cleared to play again and will be a \u201cfull go\u201d at training camp, Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe downstream, potential silver lining of these events, like Damar and Bronny, is that it raises awareness that there should be AEDs everywhere,\u201d Drezner said. \u201cTheir should be AEDs everywhere that people are playing sports and our kids are exercising.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside class=\"related left\"\/><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Lauren Mascarenhas | CNN Amid an outpouring of support from fans, friends and fellow athletes, experts say Bronny James and his doctors can now focus on his specific road to recovery after the older son of NBA star LeBron James suffered cardiac arrest during basketball practice Monday at the University of Southern California.
