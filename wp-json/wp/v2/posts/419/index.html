The family arrived at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/disney-world-opens-brand-new-disney-vacation-club-resort-villas-bb1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Disney Vacation Club<\/a> resort on July 17, 2023, celebrating their son\u2019s first birthday. While relaxing in their room, they heard a deafening bang. At first, they assumed it was a firecracker or perhaps a stray golf ball had broken the windows of a car. The noise terrified her one-year-old and newborn.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said when it dawned on her that what she had actually heard was a gunshot, she contacted the front desk, who were already aware of the situation. They were told that the guest in the connecting studio to their one-bedroom had taken their own life, and Disney asked them to stay inside their villa. The Redditor said that was exactly the opposite of what they wanted to do. All they could think about was getting out of there. The family was uncomfortable and just wanted to put distance bewteen themselves and the resort. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were kept on theor room for sp long that they missed their doning reservation at Chef Mickey\u2019s. Eventually the Cast Members at Old Key West arranged for them to go to their dining reservation late and alerted staff ahead of time what the family had experienced. At that point, the Redditor says Cast Members tried their best to keep them from returning\u00a0 to their room while law enforcement officers were in and out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She says, \u201cThe Resort did everything to try and keep us out of the room and around. Chef Mickeys even kept us later and did extra magic, but honestly, I couldn\u2019t get over the noise. It scared my one-year-old and newborn to death.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_152215\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-152215\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-152215\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\" http:=\"\" alt=\"contemporary resort chef mickey's\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1-768x433.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1-50x28.jpg 50w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" data-lazy-src=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1.jpg\"\/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-152215\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-152215\" src=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1.jpg\" alt=\"contemporary resort chef mickey's\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1-768x433.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cm1-50x28.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\/><\/noscript><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-152215\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: Disney<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She went on to say that the Cast Members at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.disneydining.com\/chef-mickeys-to-return-to-buffet-style-dining-ks1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chef Mickey\u2019s<\/a> went above and beyond for them.
