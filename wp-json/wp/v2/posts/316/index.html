The Baltimore graduate student drops out of her program after a painful breakup and moves back in with her mother, Marissa, in Oakland.<\/p>\n<p>Marissa\u2019s life has been hard, and she has struggled with depression, but recently, her luck has turned around. She\u2019s engaged to a Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur and has enlisted Kathleen to plan her bachelorette party in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, a floundering Kathleen takes a job at a start-up that matches lonely people with professional cuddlers.<\/p>\n<p>This conversation has been condensed and edited for length and clarity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can you talk about the origins of this novel?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I started working on it in earnest my last year of grad school, in 2015. Kathleen and Marissa were characters I\u2019d been playing with in short stories for a workshop. Some of the more standalone chapters in the book actually spring from that. It eventually evolved out of the short story collection idea, but these characters stayed, and I think I was really interested in them because I wanted to explore this mother-daughter dynamic, which is really fascinating to me. It\u2019s something I obviously have firsthand experience with.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s such a fraught relationship. There are so many rules and expectations and limitations and dangers involved that you have to deal with. And I wanted to explore another level of that, which is what happens when you\u2019re an immigrant family, and you are not only a mother and daughter divided by generation, but also by culture. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve also lived. When my family moved from Shanghai to California, they moved me physically into a world that they couldn\u2019t understand. When I grew up, my mom and I clashed a lot over values and cultural touchpoints and understandings. We also had a language barrier that got worse and worse as I slowly lost my Mandarin. I was playing with those factors with Kathleen and Marissa. What is it like to complicate a mother-daughter relationship that\u2019s already complicated with these cultural gaps?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Was it at all painful or fraught writing about the conflict between them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was painful and cathartic. The thing I wanted to keep in mind when I was writing them was that I wanted them to hurt each other, but not mean to. You\u2019re able to hurt the people that you love the most because you know them so well, and you know what their insecurities are, and the same for them towards you. I wanted it to be true to life in that I wanted people to be empathetic towards them and know where they were coming from, but also be able to cast judgment on them when they were willfully mean or acting out of anger or sadness. And it was painful to just relive that truth. What does it feel like to be mean towards someone that you love and care for?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: Kathleen was studying psychology before she dropped out of Johns Hopkins. Do you think that her knowledge of psychology helps her navigate her relationship with her mom?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think it definitely hinders her. Her studies on cognitive psychology are rooted in the study of haptics, and she\u2019s coming at it from a very academic, research-based viewpoint where she\u2019s researching touch, but very far away from the actual human element of touch. She\u2019s more looking at the neuroscience level of it. So it\u2019s very abstract, and she\u2019s in her head about it. She\u2019s pretty cerebral about it. I wanted her to find touch in a new way, and think about connection in a new way. So when the cuddling comes up, it\u2019s a little bit like, \u201cOh, this is embodying her research on touch in a completely new way and making it really fleshy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: It seems that Kathleen almost resents Marissa, even if it\u2019s subconsciously, for her newfound happiness.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I wanted to wrestle with that and try to put myself in her head and what she might be feeling. Kathleen is in a very susceptible and vulnerable place. A lot of things that she thought she was on the right track for, she\u2019s totally fallen off. She\u2019s going through this breakup with someone that she thought was going to be her person, and she is not sure, academically and career-wise if she\u2019s heading in the right direction. She had this idea of Marissa in her head of being this broken, vulnerable person, that she is more powerful than, in the sense that she has to take care of her. Then she goes home and finds Marissa completely on top of the world, succeeding in this very conventional way of being married and fitting into Silicon Valley and about to be financially stable for probably the first time in her life.<\/p>\n<p>So Kathleen definitely feels resentful and jealous, but also guilty about the resentment and jealousy that she feels. You can see it manifest itself in the way that she is dragging her feet while planning her mom\u2019s bachelorette party. And she\u2019s jealous of Brian too, trying to figure out like, \u201cWhat is it about my mom\u2019s fianc\u00e9 that has picked her up out of her despair, and couldn\u2019t I do that for her?\u201d She also feels a layer of not being good enough, or not being enough of a reason for her mom to want to be better and happier. So she definitely feels this complex mix of loving her mom and wanting what\u2019s best for her, but also feeling like it was supposed to be her time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q: In an essay for the Atlantic, you noted that your mother isn\u2019t able to read your book, writing, \u201cI\u2019ve essentially written a love letter that the recipient can\u2019t decipher.\u201d I imagine she\u2019s familiar with the idea behind the book, though?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>She\u2019s familiar with the broad strokes. She understands, and I think she\u2019s understood for a long time, that this is a book about mothers and daughters and that it would be drawing a lot from our specific struggles as a mother and daughter with different views of what success is, and what stability is, and why that might be like so deeply colored by the way we grew up. Writing this book was very much a great way to kind of unpack that, and for me to come to an understanding with that.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"related left\"\/><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Jenny Xie visited Los Angeles recently to discuss her debut novel, \u201cHolding Pattern,\u201d it was a homecoming of sorts.
