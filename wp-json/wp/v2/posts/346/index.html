Tamra decided the afternoon of slipping and sliding across the backyard of Emily\u2019s mother-in-law Pary\u2019s lawn needed a spark. She untied a knot and voila, topless slip-and-slide on her knees, leaning back like Bruce Springsteen in that Super Bowl halftime show \u2013 except Bruce kept his top on.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTamra Judge, cover your (place where a burlesque dancer wears pasties), we do not have a budget for pixelation!\u201d shouted Gina Kirschenheiter from off-camera.<\/p>\n<p>Pary, who is a proper grownup, hasn\u2019t finished rolling her eyes at Tamra when into the frame flies her daughter-in-law, Emily, catching up with Tamra on the slip-and-slide.<\/p>\n<p>(Bravo apparently found enough money under the cushions of the Housewives\u2019 couches to afford pixelation of their not-so-private parts.)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, not all the Housewives were as keen to feel fresh air on their flesh. Shannon Storms Beador is always a bit more reluctant to let it all hang out, and Heather Dubrow wore a full-body wetsuit to avoid coming into contact with any of the slip-and-slide water which had quickly turned mucky from washed-off spray tan and spilled champagne.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith this suit, my body doesn\u2019t touch the ick,\u201d Heather explains.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I planned this party, I envisioned all these hot girlfriends in bikinis,\u201d Emily grumbled to the camera. \u201cBut I got Shannon in her Spanx and Heather looking like a whale trainer at Sea World.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not Girls Gone Wild, this is not Cougars Gone Wild, this is not even like Grannies Gone Wild,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is nobody\u2019s gone wild.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The only other action of note during the pool party was what might be \u2013 but almost definitely won\u2019t be \u2013 a wrap on the hullabaloo over Jenn Pedranti and her boyfriend Ryan, a relationship some of the women, Tamra most of all, do not believe is good for Jenn.<\/p>\n<p>This storyline is so tired I\u2019ve taken off my own bikini top in protest. To quote Taylor Armstrong as this particular drama was revving up again: \u201cWhat is happening? Do we not have anything better to talk about?\u201d<\/p>\n<aside class=\"related left\"\/>\n<p>Apparently not.<\/p>\n<p>To sum up, according to some on the show, Ryan has a reputation and Tamra ripped into Jenn on the previous episode for sticking with him. This week Tamra brought the source of several of those Ryan rumors, Heather Amin, a mutual friend, to the pool party to watch what happens.<\/p>\n<p>This week, the focus on the period where Jenn and Ryan took a break from their relationship \u2013 \u201cLike Ross and Rachel,\u201d Heather previously and correctly identified the template seen on \u201cFriends.\u201d Jenn had acknowledged that during the break Ryan had spent time with another woman. To paraphrase Joan Jett, Jenn don\u2019t give a damn about his bad reputation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t like some Nancy Drew mystery solved and you guys just gave me information,\u201d Jenn tells the camera once, dismissing Ryan\u2019s rep as old news.<\/p>\n<p>But \u2026 she kinda does care, as she tearfully admitted to Tamra as they made up, Tamra apologizing for having \u201cover-drank\u201d on the previous episode, and having over-drank, threw a napkin in Jenn\u2019s face.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what else we saw on this week\u2019s episode:<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Vicki Gunvalson returned! The self-proclaimed OG of the OC reunited the Tres Amigas near the end of the episode, meeting Tamra and Shannon for shots of tequila and food of some sort. A cheese plate, not even charcuterie, pfft. Vicki\u2019s so moved by the spirit (or the spirits) she asks the others to join hands for a prayer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLord, thank you for bringing us together again. I\u2019ve missed my friends. And let\u2019s learn how to whoop it up again!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI love that you\u2019re telling Jesus that we need to whoop it up again,\u201d Tamra says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe understands me,\u201d Vicki replies.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 The tequila-and-cheese session is interrupted when Shannon figures out from Tamra\u2019s hints that Heather has betrayed Shannon\u2019s confidences and concerns about her relationship with her boyfriend John. In an unusual glimpse behind the curtain, Shannon gets up from the table and goes to confront the production team on the other side of the restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d she tells them. \u201cThis is going to destroy things. My relationship is over if this is on the air.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The resolution to this cliffhanger arrives next week.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what else we learned this week:<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 It\u2019s good to see Jenn and Ryan in therapy together. And it\u2019s curious to see inside a therapy session run by an \u201cintuitive healer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jenn tells the healer there\u2019s been a lot of stress around them lately (thanks, Tamra) and asks her to clear that energy. The healer then chants a single low note for a breath so long Wynton Marsalis might be envious.<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Early in the episode Gina gets roasted by her boyfriend Travis for hardly ever cooking. So, of course, she\u2019s seen later making him chicken parmigiana and stuffed artichokes as befits her partly Italian heritage. But she\u2019s got a shameful secret to reveal.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t tell anybody from back home that I buy jarred sauce,\u201d she tells the camera, whispering jarred sauce so not even the neighbors will know. \u201cIt\u2019s so bad! \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Gina, and I buy jarred sauce.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 The episode opened with Emily and Shane out for a couples\u2019 waxing. We see the spa attendant put hot wax in their nostrils and then rip it free of nasty nose hairs. There is also waxing conducted in other places that your grandmother would probably only ever refer to as \u201cdown there.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside class=\"related right\">\n<\/aside><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Emily Simpson\u2019s husband Shane had one question after the pool party his wife hosted on \u201cThe Real Housewives of Orange County\u201d Wednesday: \u201cDid Tamra take her off her top?\u201d It\u2019s not as weird of a question as it might seem to newcomers to the show.
