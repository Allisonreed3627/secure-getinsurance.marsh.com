She reached out to local police who confirmed that the substance found was an illegal drug. <\/p>\n<p>According to the Chula Vista Police Department, it\u2019s not a trend yet but it\u2019s a known drug dealing tactic: using someone else\u2019s name and address to send illicit drugs. In this case, it impacted a small business owner, wife, and mom of four.<\/p>\n<p>Ring camera video in one family-friendly Chula Vista neighborhood captured the moments one USPS employee dropped off what appeared to be an ordinary envelope at first glance for resident Graciela Arangure. <\/p>\n<div class=\"nlp-ignore-block article-content rich-text\">\n<aside class=\"promo-link\">\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/fox5sandiego.com\/news\/local-news\/elderly-man-found-dead-near-rancho-bernardo-trail\/?ipid=promo-link-block1\" class=\"promo-link__link\" target=\"&quot;_blank&quot;\" rel=\"noopener\"><br \/>\n\t\tElderly man found dead near Rancho Bernardo trail\t<\/a><br \/>\n<\/aside>\n<\/div>\n<p>Upon opening it, she said, \u201cI kind of felt it and I was like okay, it could be three or four random latex balloons in here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That would be common, given she runs a home-based party decoration business called Creations by Chelyz. However, what was inside was anything but. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI saw this black Ziploc bag that was thinly bubble wrapped and I\u2019m like okay, that\u2019s weird,\u201d Arangure explained.<\/p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab\">\n<\/aside>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t balloons inside, but rather three small packets of a suspicious white powdery substance believed to be a drug. <\/p>\n<p>Arangure later realized the envelope carrying the substance stated \u201creturn to sender\u201d with her business name stamped as the sender, as if she had shipped it out. <\/p>\n<aside class=\"inline-related-stories\">   <\/aside>\n<p>\u201cIf somebody is sending something out and they don\u2019t have to put their own name on it, it now creates some distance from the actual person involved in the crime,\u201d explained Sgt. Anthony Molina with CVPD. <\/p>\n<p>After seeing the suspicious substance, Arangure quickly contacted police who arrived that night to investigate the package. <\/p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr2_ab\">\n<\/aside>\n<p>\u201cThey were going back and forth, asking themselves, \u2018is it cocaine?\u2019 Then the other cop said \u2018no, this is fentanyl,&#8217;\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Police have yet to confirm that officially. <\/p>\n<p>As for Arangure, a business owner and a mother of four, she\u2019s just happy she and her family are safe. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis substance could have just been loose.
