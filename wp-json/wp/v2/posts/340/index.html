On Aug. 2, a \u201cCup Noodles Geo Selfie Live\u201d is planned, though it\u2019s unclear from the schedule what that\u2019s all about \u2014 but hopefully there\u2019s some fun noodle slurping involved.<\/p>\n<p>On Aug. 3, there is a WSL Ocean x Shiseido Public Beach Cleanup planned to help pick up any mess left on the beach.<\/p>\n<p>That same day, the first scheduled music performance by Sweet Nobody will happen on the main stage at 2 p.m. On Aug. 4, a music performance by Nice &amp; Swell is planned.

The event happens in front of Huntington Surf and Sport on the corner of Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"\">Where to eat<\/h4>\n<p>For the last decade, Steve Van Doren, son of Vans co-founder Paul Van Doren, has served up thousands of free hot dogs on the sand.<\/p>\n<p>But with<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailybreeze.com\/2023\/02\/08\/vans-pulls-out-of-us-open-of-surfing-sponsorship\/\"> Vans pulling out as this year\u2019s sponsor<\/a>, you\u2019re on your own to find food.<\/p>\n<p>This year, food trucks have been added to the festival landscape, so you can line up for an array of offerings if you want to get some grub on the sand \u2013 but you\u2019ll have to pay.<\/p>\n<p>A few of the food truck offerings include Baby\u2019s Burgers, Tacos 4 Troops, Bred Hot Chicken, Flames All Stars Pizza, Salt N Pepper Truck, The Empanada Maker, Drizzle and Scooters Italian Ice.<\/p>\n<p>And, there\u2019s plenty of surfer-vibe eateries around town if you really want to soak in the OC beach lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>Sessions West Coast Deli right across the street has killer breakfast burritos and sandwiches named after local surf breaks.<\/p>\n<p>Sugar Shack Caf\u00e9 on Main Street is a local favorite for a post-surf breakfast. Fun fact: The family operated eatery has three Surfers\u2019 Hall of Fame inductees, brothers Timmy and Ryan Turner and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ocregister.com\/2022\/08\/05\/surfers-put-hands-feet-in-cement-to-mark-surfers-hall-of-fame-induction\/\">mom Michele Turner<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Wahoo\u2019s Fish Taco on Main Street is another surfer favorite. Wing Lam set out in 1988 to open a casual restaurant that catered to surfers like himself, drawing inspiration from travels to wave-rich Baja and Hawaii. The Huntington Beach location opened up in 1992 and has been serving up surfers for more than 30 years.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be transported to Hawaii, don\u2019t miss the poke from Bear Flag Fish Co. at Pacific City, the perfect cool down for a hot summer day.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"\">Where to park<\/h4>\n<p>Huntington Beach is set up for massive events, with plenty of parking structures downtown and on the streets just steps from the sand.<\/p>\n<p>But be warned: Beachfront parking will be at a premium and tough to score.<\/p>\n<p>The Pier Plaza parking lots, both north and south of the pier, are the closest spots to nab. Cost is $2 an hour or $15 daily max.<\/p>\n<p>There are lots of meter spots along Pacific Coast Highway \u2013 from Goldenwest Boulevard to Beach Boulevard \u2013 that cost $2 an hour.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a State Park pass, it might be worth parking at Huntington State Beach at Beach Boulevard and PCH, and walking north toward the pier. Day use passes there are $15.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll find the most parking available at downtown structures, which also allow you to pop into shops or grab a bite or cocktail in the downtown area.<\/p>\n<p>Another option is to park at Pacific City, just across the street from the action, where you can find discounts or validations if you shop or eat in the plaza.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"\">Weather and what to wear<\/h4>\n<p>Slather on the sunscreen. Lots of it.<\/p>\n<p>Forecasts are calling for temps in the mid-80s for the first weekend, so it will be toasty. You may also want to pack a hat or umbrella to keep out of the sun.<\/p>\n<p>The weather is expected to dip slightly into the upper 70s early next week, before going back into the 80s heading into the finals weekend.<\/p>\n<p>But be warned: Mornings have been overcast and foggy along the coast, so you might want to layer up if you\u2019re headed down early.<\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On any given summer day, Huntington Beach is one of the busiest beaches in the country \u2013 but add the US Open of Surfing, and a day at the beach can turn into a massive maze of festivities to navigate.
