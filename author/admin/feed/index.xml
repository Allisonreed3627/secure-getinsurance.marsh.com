<p>Disneyland is considered hallowed ground for fans of Tiki culture who make annual pilgrimages in Hawaiian shirts, straw hats and puka shell necklaces to sip mai tais at Trader Sam’s and visit the crowning glory of the kitsch movement — Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room.</p>
<p>Disneyland’s Tiki history stretches from the Enchanted Tiki Room attraction, Tahitian Terrace restaurant and Don the Beachcomber food stand to the Trader Sam’s Enchanted Tiki Bar cocktail lounge, Tropical Hideaway grab-and-go dining area and Tikiland Day annual event.</p>

<p>Tiki culture was born in the 1930s as U.S. travel opened to Polynesian, Caribbean, Hawaiian and South Pacific islands. Cultural appropriation spawned themed bars and Hollywood movies that tapped into Americans’ escapist fascination with the romantic and adventurous tropical settings. World War II soldiers gave the Tiki craze a boost when they returned from duty in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Walt Disney tapped into that tropical fever with Adventureland when Disneyland opened in 1955 with a Hollywood movie set designer’s vision of the jungle and island regions of the world. Nearly 70 years later, fans of the whimsical trappings of Tiki culture are still drawn to Adventureland and the odes to a bygone era that continue to stir up nostalgic yearnings.</p>
<p>The annual <a href="https://www.tikilandtrading.com/pages/tikiland-day">Tikiland Day</a> returning to Disneyland on Sept. 10 celebrates the fun, fashion and art of all things Tiki. Tikiland Day is an off-shoot of Adventureland Day — another unofficial Disneyland event that draws like-minded fans of tropical attire, cocktails and escapism.</p>

<p>The 1963 Enchanted Tiki Room show was the first Disneyland attraction to feature audio-animatronic animated figures created by WED Enterprises, the precursor to Walt Disney Imagineering.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2023/03/13/appreciation-how-the-worst-artist-walt-disney-ever-hired-shaped-disneyland-forever/">late Imagineer Rolly Crump</a> — who hand-carved the Tiki mask sculptures for Disneyland’s Tiki Room — remains the revered patron saint of the Tiki culture community and fans of the kitschy South Pacific design.</p>

<p>Crump <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2019/11/04/review-the-imagineering-story-takes-a-no-holds-barred-look-at-disneylands-birth-and-youth/">recounted the birth of the Tiki Room</a> in the Disney+ documentary “The Imagineering Story” and told a decidedly un-Disney story about Walt’s colorful concerns about early plans that conceived of the bird show as a restaurant.</p>
<p>“Walt always wanted a tea room, but instead we’re going to do a little restaurant,” Crump said in the Disney+ documentary. “John Hench was asked to do a rendering and in there he had birds in cages. Walt took one look at it and said, ‘John, you can’t have birds in cages.’ John says, ‘Why not?’ Walt says, ‘Because they’ll poop in the food.’ That’s exactly what he said. We all cracked up. John said, ‘No, no, no. Maybe they’re little mechanical birds.’ And Walt said, ‘Oh, little mechanical birds.’ And that’s how it all got started.”</p>

<p>While Disneyland still operates an original version of the Enchanted Tiki Room, other Disney parks have not treated the audio-animatronic bird attraction with as much reverence.</p>
<p>For a decade or so in Florida, the Tiki Room at Disney World’s Magic Kingdom was put under the new management of Iago and Zazu, the wisecracking birds from “Aladdin” and “The Lion King.” Tokyo Disneyland has treated the beloved singing bird show even worse, adding a Las Vegas nightclub theme to the Tiki Room in 1999 and a Hawaiian “Lilo and Stitch” overlay in 2008.</p>

<p>The Trader Sam’s Enchanted Tiki Bar became an instant hit when it opened in 2011 at the Disneyland Hotel. The Imagineering-designed Tiki bar includes nods to Disney films and features audio-animatronics along with lighting, sound and special effects. The bar’s lineup of <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2019/12/02/expect-big-lines-for-jungle-cruise-tiki-mug-as-disneyland-fans-turn-out-for-trader-sams-collectible/">limited edition Tiki mugs</a> often draws long lines of the faithful who rave about the collectible designs.</p>
<p>Next door to Trader Sam’s is the Tangaroa Terrace bar and grill with Tiki torches, tropical music and a South Seas menu with a Polynesian twist.</p>
<p>A second Trader Sam’s opened in 2015 in Florida at the Tiki-inspired Polynesian Village resort hotel that debuted in 1971 at Walt Disney World.</p>

<p>The Trader Sam’s bars take their names from the culturally insensitive Jungle Cruise headhunter character that was removed from the Disneyland river boat attraction in 2021.</p>
<p>Trader Sam’s Enchanted Tiki Bar owes a debt to Don the Beachcomber in Hollywood and Trader Vic’s in Oakland — the rival Tiki bars that gave birth to the pop culture movement in the mid-1930s and both lay claim to creating the mai tai cocktail.</p>
<p>The short-lived <a href="https://yesterland.com/hollywooddine.html">Hollywood &amp; Dine food court</a> that opened in 2001 with Disney California Adventure in Soundstage 12 of Hollywood Land included a food stand called Don the Beachcomber. The Chinese take-out eatery featured a dining area themed to look like a Tiki lounge with bamboo, oars, totems and puffer fish lamps.</p>

<p>Disneyland opened the <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2018/12/11/heres-what-disneylands-new-tropical-hideaway-in-adventureland-looks-like/">Tropical Hideaway</a> grab-and-go dining area in 2018 between the Tiki Room and Jungle Cruise in the tight confines of Adventureland. Diners can nosh on a menu of lumpia, bao buns and ramen while sipping Dole Whips under the glow of tiki torches and chatting with an animatronic bird.</p>
<p>The Tropical Hideaway helps take some of the pressure off of the always-crowded Dole Whip stand in front of the Tiki Room at the entrance to Adventureland — and offers a few additional flavors that can be swirled with the traditional pineapple soft serve.</p>
<p>Tropical Hideaway occupies the former location of <a href="https://www.yesterland.com/tahitianterrace.html">Tahitian Terrace</a> — another temple of Tiki culture that operated in Adventureland from 1962 to 1993. The Tahitian Terrace dinner theater offered dishes from Tahiti, Samoa and Hawaii along with a stage show featuring fire walkers and hula dancers.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney is the most magical place on Earth, but it can sometimes also be the most tragic. There are back-to-back reports of deaths at Disney World this week. Yesterday <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/guest-falls-to-their-death-at-contemporary-resort-in-walt-disney-world-ma1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports surfaced claiming that a guest tragically fell to their death at Disney’s Contemporary Resort.</a> Now another guest has come forward to share a terrifying situation they encountered just last week. Sadly, another suicide.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/15a4lol/pretty_sure_someone_just_died_at_bay_lake_towers/jtivii3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">u/disabled_flowers95</a>  reports that she and her family were witness to a guest taking their life last week at Old Key West Resort. The family arrived at the <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-world-opens-brand-new-disney-vacation-club-resort-villas-bb1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney Vacation Club</a> resort on July 17, 2023, celebrating their son’s first birthday. While relaxing in their room, they heard a deafening bang. At first, they assumed it was a firecracker or perhaps a stray golf ball had broken the windows of a car. The noise terrified her one-year-old and newborn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said when it dawned on her that what she had actually heard was a gunshot, she contacted the front desk, who were already aware of the situation. They were told that the guest in the connecting studio to their one-bedroom had taken their own life, and Disney asked them to stay inside their villa. The Redditor said that was exactly the opposite of what they wanted to do. All they could think about was getting out of there. The family was uncomfortable and just wanted to put distance bewteen themselves and the resort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were kept on theor room for sp long that they missed their doning reservation at Chef Mickey’s. Eventually the Cast Members at Old Key West arranged for them to go to their dining reservation late and alerted staff ahead of time what the family had experienced. At that point, the Redditor says Cast Members tried their best to keep them from returning  to their room while law enforcement officers were in and out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She says, “The Resort did everything to try and keep us out of the room and around. Chef Mickeys even kept us later and did extra magic, but honestly, I couldn’t get over the noise. It scared my one-year-old and newborn to death.” </span></p>

They had special desserts made, and everyone was very sympathetic. When they were finished eating, the Cast Members even arranged a private character meet and greet for them, and the kids got to spend as much time with them as they wanted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Redditor stated that Disney offered them grief counseling but did not offer to move them to a different resort which they would have liked. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Potential tragic news today at Walt Disney World Resort as reports suggest that a visitor at Bay Lake Tower has fallen to their death. The sad information was released to Twitter by user <em>The Rogue Attraction</em> and later published by <a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2023/07/death-reported-guest-disney-world-ld1/">Inside the Magic</a>. Initial reports claim that while attempting to use the 5th-floor bridge that connects Bay Lake Tower to the Contemporary Resort, Guests were stopped by emergency service personnel and not allowed to cross due to an apparent suicide.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sadly, Walt Disney World is no stranger to death, including suicide. The same can be said for the <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/contemporary-cuisine-with-a-view-dining-at-california-grill-ck1/">Contemporary Resort</a>. As this isn’t the first time an apparent suicide has occurred at this location, Guests may be surprised to learn the frequency of attempts to end life here. A similar situation happened at the Contemporary, which sits right outside of <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/horse-gets-spooked-with-merida-during-magic-kingdom-daytime-parade-bb1/">Magic Kingdom</a>, in 2020 when a 22-year-old woman jumped to her death from the 4th floor of the Resort.</span></p>

<p>“<em>There’s this weird phenomenon where people who are severely depressed but want to<strong> </strong></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><em>have that one last good happy family memory will go to Walt Disney World.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The current details surrounding this most recent event at the Contemporary Resort remain quiet. Although it isn’t entirely uncommon for Disney World to keep matters like this away from the press, there is little information to report outside of what is being shared on social media. Guests at the Contemporary did also tweet that they were not allowed to enter the bridge to <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disneys-new-board-talks-controversy-and-big-changes-for-disney-world-bb1/">Bay Lake Tower</a> as security and other crews were still cleaning and investigating the scene.</span></p>

<h2>Bay Lake Tower</h2>
<p>Bay Lake Tower at Disney’s Contemporary Resort opened in 2009 at the Walt Disney World Resort. Although meant to serve as a stand-alone Resort dedication to <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/rumor-big-price-increase-coming-for-disney-vacation-cub-members-ks1/">Disney Vacation Club</a> members, it is widley considered part of Disney’s deluxe Resort offering that famoulsy sits upon the <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/walt-disney-worlds-monorail-reportedly-closing-ir1/">monorail</a> to Magic Kingdom. A large bridge reached from the 5th floor of  Bay Lake Tower to the Grand Canyon Concourse of the main building providing easy access to shopping and dining options available at the Contemporary.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There has been no official statement by Walt Disney World or local authorities, so it is difficult to suggest that the fall resulted from a <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-parks-suicides-bb1/">suicide</a> attempt. However, many Guests indicate that the action that led to the death of a Disney World Guest was intentional. We will update this story as more details are released to the public.</span></p>
<p>As the Disney World Resort is home to  themeParks such as <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/best-disney-dining-plan-restaurants-at-epcot-ml1/">EPCOT</a>, Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom (as well as water Parks and Disney Springs), it’s difficult to understand why anyone would consider suicide at “The Most Magical Place On Earth.” Although there isn’t extreme clarity regarding what happened at this specific Disney World Resort hotel today, suicide’s do happen at and around Disney Theme Parks. As the United States boasts one of the highest rates for suicide attempts and ideation in the world, we want to make sure that our readers have the proper resources.

<p>It’s no secret that Disney World is known as the quintessential family vacation destination. Every year, millions of families make the pilgrimage to Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort to spend some quality time with their families. However, as the years have gone by, more and more adult Disney fans are proudly enjoying child-free Disney vacations.</p>
<p>This begs the question, should Disney be offering <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-adults-are-not-psychopaths-after-all-bb1/">adult-only</a> Disney days?</p>
<div id="attachment_175314" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-21-2.jpg"><noscript><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175314" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-175314" src="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-21-2.jpg" alt="walt disney world adults only magic kingdom cinderella castle couple" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-21-2.jpg 1200w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-21-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-21-2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-21-2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-21-2-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"/></noscript></a></p>

<h2>It’s Not Just for Kids!</h2>
<p>While many people believe that Disney is just for children, the reality is that that couldn’t be further from the truth. A massive portion of Disney Park fans are proud adults who enjoy the magic of Disney regardless of age. After all, when Walt Disney once said;</p>
<p><i><strong>“I think what I want Disneyland to be most of all is a happy place- a place where adults and children can experience together some of the wonders of life, adventure, and feel better because of it.”</strong></i></p>
<p>This sentiment has held true, and the Parks have more adult-geared entertainment than ever. The addition of the <i>Star Wars </i>and Marvel lands, as well as the surplus of alcoholic beverages, makes it feel that Disney is really catering to an older demographic. The concept of a <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/entitled-disney-adults-are-the-problem-not-kids-jb1/">‘Disney Adult’</a> has been gaining popularity within the Disney Parks community.</p>

<h2>Could an 18+ Disney Day Be Happening?</h2>
<p>This week, rumors of an “adults only Disney day” <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/adult-only-days-disney/">have been circling the internet</a>. Many people are shocked by this idea, while others are excited by the possibility. However, at this time, there is no such thing. This fake event was reported on my mousetrapnews.com, a parody website.</p>

<p>Still, the demand for this kind of thing seems to be entirely legitimate. After all, it is adults who are the ones buying a ticket to Disney and planning a Disney vacation in the first place! Perhaps the excitement over this idea will convince Disney to add this to the Park. If it were to be added, it is more likely that it would be an after-hours event instead of an entire day at the theme Park.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, it was reported that he made a 7-figure donation to the SAG-AFTRA Foundation, a non for profit group associated with the union which provides <a href="https://sagaftra.foundation/emergencyfinancialassistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emergency assistance</a> to the union members. His donation was the “single largest donation” the foundation has ever received since its founding in 1985.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the news were stories about Dwayne Johnson facing a $3 billion lawsuit for kidnapping. It alleged that the actor (along with many other celebrities, sports stars, and government agencies) was involved in a conspiracy to kidnap the wrestler Trenesha Biggers, known by her ring name “Rhaka Khan”.</p>

<h2>Calls for a <em>Pocahontas</em> (1995) Remake with The Rock</h2>
<p>Beginning last month, a large Disney fan has formed a petition on Change.org to the Walt Disney Company, asking the entertainment giant to make a live action remake of the animated classic <em>Pocahontas</em> (1995).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/live-action-stitch-just-got-way-worse-em1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live Action Stitch Just Got More Horrifying; Fans Petition for Disney to Cancel the Film</a></strong></em></p>
<p>This particular push comes on the heels of the Walt Disney Company making multiple remakes of their animated films. The petition filed by Taran Kaynes requests that Sofia Crnilovic, a social media influencer, take the helm of the Native American character.</p>

<p>The petition further requests that Dwayne Johnson star as Chief Powhatan in the feature film. Presumably, such a casting wouldn’t be too complicated since Dwayne Johnson has a long history of working with Walt Disney Studios on other films such as <em>Moana</em> (2016) and <i>Jungle Cruise </i>(2021).</p>

<p>Should Disney remake <em>Pocahontas</em> (1995) as its next live action movie? They’ve already hit most of the films of the Disney Renaissance with <em>The Little Mermaid</em> (2023), <em>Aladdin</em> (2019), <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> (2017), <em>Mulan</em> (2020), and <em>The Lion King</em> (2019). What’s one more? Perhaps Disney could even get Lin Manuel Miranda to pen a new song or two.</p>

<p>The Walt Disney Company is working hard to promote the new <em>Haunted Mansion</em> (2023) film. You’ve undoubtedly seen trailers for it, Disney merchandise, and probably came across a social media post or two. In another effort by Disney to create excitement for the movie (especially since actors aren’t allowed to promote the film during the strike), the Disney Parks Blog is offering Haunted Mansion wallpaper…for your smartphone, smartwatch, tablet, or desktop computer.</p>
<h2>The Haunting Wallpaper</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/wallpapers/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q4wo0720230008I">free wallpaper</a> comes in various sizes and images. There are the classic Hitchhiking Ghosts, the exterior of the Disneyland Park attraction, and the stretching room. Each image comes with the Disney <em>Haunted Mansion</em> (2023) logo, promoting the film.</p>

<h2>The <em>Haunted Mansion</em> (2023) Movie</h2>
<p>The new movie is coming to theaters on July 28. It stars various A-list celebrities, including Rosario Dawson, Danny DeVito, Owen Wilson, Lakeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Jamie Lee Curtis as Madame Leota, and Jared Leto as the iconic Hatbox Ghost.</p>

<p>Rated PG-13, the movie allegedly (according to the director Justin Simien) attempts to blend classic scares with light-hearted comedy – similar to how the attraction combines the two elements. Fans of the ride are expected to enjoy the movie since it will incorporate many iconic elements, such as the stretching room, the ballroom scene, and the hitchhiking ghosts. We shall see…</p>

Many in the media and Disney fans cheered the news as they viewed Bob Iger as one of the few individuals who could save the Walt Disney Company.</p>

<p>However you feel about former Disney CEO Bob Chapek or current Disney CEO Bob Iger, there is a little more to the story. As some may or may not know, when Bob Iger initially stepped down, he didn’t walk away from the company – or even his office. He remained vital to the board and the Walt Disney Company while Bob Chapek took the reins. This is part of why it was so easy for the Walt Disney Company to bring Iger back after the stock price fell and the battle with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had begun.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/trouble-for-the-house-of-mouse-disney-stock-tumbling-towards-a-52-week-low-em1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Following Bob Iger’s Contract Extension, Disney Stock is Tumbling Towards a One-Year Low</a></strong></em></p>
<p>But this month when the media reported on Disney CEO Bob Iger staying until 2026, many didn’t know that paper work actually puts him in a position of power until 2031. Although he won’t officially be CEO (at least as of now) between 2026 and 2031, he will serve in an advisory role.</p>

<p>Some have speculated that CFO Christine McCarthy’s departure was partly due to theory that Bob Iger isn’t planning to leave the company – ever. And if you are someone who aspires to be a CEO someday, maybe the Walt Disney Company isn’t the best place to be.</p>

<p>“The amendment also provides that the post-retirement security benefits to be provided to Mr. Iger for five years following his termination of employment under his current employment agreement will not be reduced for the approximately 11-month period such services were provided following Mr. Iger’s prior retirement on December 31, 2021.”</p>

<p>When Bob Iger initially retired in 2021, he was given a five year contract in an advisory role. This amendment implies that the clock of his five post-retirement role will restart when he retires…again…in 2026.</p>
<p>So whoever takes the helm as Disney CEO in 2026 will do so while Bob Iger watches from the sidelines as a board member or at least a secret advisor. It’ll be curious to see who exactly would want that job, knowing your predecessor is a few steps away, perhaps judging you, maybe criticizing you behind your back to the board, or somehow make another attempt to steal your job and reclaim his throne as Disney CEO.</p>

<h2>The Bill That Started It All</h2>
<p>In March of last year (2022), the Florida legislature passed a bill to limit the instruction of gender identity and sexual orientation in grades K-3. The bill was criticized by many claiming that it targeted members of the LGBTQ+ community and could cause harm to students who identify as such, as well as teachers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-bob-iger-comments-on-hiring-bob-chapek-js1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney’s Iger Comments on His Decision to Hire Bob Chapek</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Since the Walt Disney Company was one of the biggest employers in Florida, there was a lot of pressure put on it to take a stand and fight the bill. Disney CEO Bob Chapek, at the time, decided to stay out of any political battles and keep the company as neutral as he could. However, this stance angered many people both in and around the company. More pressure was put on Bob Chapek to speak out on behalf of the company against the Parental Rights in Education Bill (which others called the “Don’t Say Gay” bill).</p>

<p>Finally, Bob Chapek DID speak out against the bill, but it had already been passed. So Bob Chapek then announced Disney would halt all political donations in Florida.</p>

<h2>The Battle for Reedy Creek Improvement District</h2>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis pushed back on the Walt Disney Company, claiming that since it was based in California, it had no business getting involved in Florida politics. As such, he threatened to terminate the long-standing privileges that Walt Disney World Resort enjoyed in the state. Although many thought Governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida Republicans would never be bold enough to go after Disney in such a way (i.e. eliminating the Reedy Creek Improvement District), that’s just what they did.</p>

<p>In 2023, Florida lawmakers worked to create the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, which would oversee Walt Disney World Resort’s theme parks and municipal services in the area.</p>

<p>It then came out that the Reedy Creek Improvement District had tried to set up rules and motions to limit the power of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District. Next came some harsh language by Governor DeSantis (and some more by Disney CEO Bob Iger, who was back running the company). Then came the lawsuits. One by the Walt Disney Company suing Governor Ron DeSantis. And one by the Ron DeSantis Central Florida Tourism Oversight District board against the Walt Disney Company.</p>

<h2>A Year Later</h2>
<p>And now here we are. Governor Ron DeSantis is running for president and has been criticized by Republican and Democrat politicians for his war with Disney.</p>
<div id="attachment_177545" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177545" decoding="async" class="wp-image-177545 size-full" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=" http:="" alt="florida governor ron desantis disney lawsuit lose presidential" width="1200" height="600" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1.jpg 1200w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1-50x25.jpg 50w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-lazy-src="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1.jpg"/><noscript><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177545" decoding="async" class="wp-image-177545 size-full" src="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1.jpg" alt="florida governor ron desantis disney lawsuit lose presidential" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1.jpg 1200w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.disneydining.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ld-1-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"/></noscript></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Walt Disney Company’s stock hasn’t recovered much from its low last year, Disney Plus numbers are falling, the company is not making much money at the box office, and its theme Park attendance has been reported as down. So it doesn’t seem like either party is winning in this fight. However, both continue digging their heels in deeper.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-ceo-bob-iger-speaks-out-against-desantiss-outrageous-sexualization-claims-ir1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney CEO Bob Iger Speaks Out Against DeSantis’ Outrageous “Sexualization” Claims</a></strong></em></p>
<h2>This Week</h2>
<p>Reported on July 26, the legal team representing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis requested a motion to toss out the lawsuit filed by the Walt Disney Company.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Disney has responded to Gov. DeSantis&#8217; request to dismiss the company&#8217;s lawsuit. In a filing, Disney says &#8220;the Governor seeks to evade  responsibility for his actions&#8221; and asks the court for a July 15, 2024 court date – the same day as the Republican National Convention. <a href="https://t.co/4gnI1lE6Eb">pic.twitter.com/4gnI1lE6Eb</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Disney, however, had no desire to do such a thing. They released the following statement, “The Governor seeks to evade responsibility for his actions on a narrower ground, asserting that a governor cannot be held officially liable for implementing, administering, and enforcing state laws that punish residents for political statements violating a state-prescribed speech code.”</p>

<p>The Walt Disney Company then asked for a court date set on July 15, 2024, the same day as the Republican National Convention. Meanwhile, Governor DeSantis and his team have been trying to push the court date until after the 2024 Presidential election.</p>
