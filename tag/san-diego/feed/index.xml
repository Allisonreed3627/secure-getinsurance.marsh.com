<p>SAN DIEGO — Can you guess which San Diego metro area city has the most affordable housing market?</p>
<p>If you don’t want to spend over half of your yearly income towards homeownership, then San Diego may not be the place for you — hypothetically speaking. </p>
<p>Based on the average projected income of a household, median asking price, estimated mortgage cost and taxes, there’s only one San Diego metro area city where homebuyers will be forking out less than 50% of their income for a place to call their own.</p>

<p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.realtyhop.com/for-sale/san-diego-ca#affordability-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by real estate listing platform RealtyHop, which examined home affordability for the average American family in the 100 largest U.S. cities and their surrounding metros.</p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>Based on this report’s key findings, Carlsbad is the least affordable housing market in the regional metro area. RealtyHop says households in Carlsbad spend 69.03% of their income on mortgage and property tax payments.</p>
<p>Next in line as least affordable comes Escondido, where homeowners spend 65.64% of their income on housing costs annually, this report shows.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab">
</aside>
<p>Then comes San Diego as the third least affordable city in the region, with homeowners spending 57.31% of their income and Oceanside in fourth place with residents dishing out 55.78% of their yearly earnings, according to RealtyHop.</p>
<p>The most affordable San Diego metro area city is Chula Vista, where homeowners spend 48.26% of their earned money for the year. This South Bay community also has the lowest median purchase price for a home at $725,000, the report shows. </p>
