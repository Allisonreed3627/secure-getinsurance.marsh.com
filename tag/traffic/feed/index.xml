<p>SAN DIEGO — A freeway crash near the U.S.-Mexico border left at least one person dead Wednesday afternoon, the California Highway Patrol said.</p>
<p>The crash happened shortly before noon on southbound Interstate 805 near Camino De La Plaza, which is the last U.S. exit.</p>
<p>According to CHP’s Traffic Incident Information Page, a witness reported seeing a white sedan heading towards the port of entry make a U-turn on the freeway then hit a Honda minivan.</p>
<p>CHP confirmed that the driver of the white vehicle, an Audi, was driving the wrong-way at the time of the crash, hitting the van head on.</p>
<p>“Our understanding at this point is they turned around at the point of entry and came the wrong way,” CHP Sgt. Hope Maxson said.</p>
<p>It appeared the driver may have missed the last U.S. exit, and began driving the wrong way on I-805.</p>

<p>A Sig Alert was issued by Caltrans for the right two lanes on southbound I-805 north of Camino De La Plaza. The closure was expected to last several hours, according to CHP.</p>
<p>A man driving the minivan was killed as a result of the crash. </p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>The driver of the Audi, a 29-year-old man, was transported to a nearby hospital with major, but not life-threatening injuries, CHP said.</p>

<p>The San Diego County Medical Examiner’s Office was called out to the scene of the crash.</p>
<p>Crews with San Diego Fire-Rescue Department and with the Cities of Chula Vista and National City were also on scene.</p>
<p>The incident is still under investigation and the identity of both men involved the crash have not yet been publicly released.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr3_ab">
</aside>
<p>Maxson added that drivers should be aware there is another option to turn back into the U.S.</p>
<p>“If you have missed the last U.S. exit here on the freeway, you can continue off to the left all the way down and there is a sign there that says U-turn back into U.S.A.,” Maxson said.</p>
<p>CHP also wants drivers to be aware of some ways to help protect yourself against wrong-way drivers. </p>
<p> “The safer place to be is normally the middle lanes because it tends to be that wrong-way drivers stick to the fast lane or the slow lane or the shoulders,” Maxson said. “The best thing to do is drive at a safe speed and keep a high visual horizon, looking as far down the freeway as you can.”</p>
