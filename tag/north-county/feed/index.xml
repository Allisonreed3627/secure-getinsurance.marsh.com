<p>SAN DIEGO — Can you guess which San Diego metro area city has the most affordable housing market?</p>
<p>If you don’t want to spend over half of your yearly income towards homeownership, then San Diego may not be the place for you — hypothetically speaking. </p>
<p>Based on the average projected income of a household, median asking price, estimated mortgage cost and taxes, there’s only one San Diego metro area city where homebuyers will be forking out less than 50% of their income for a place to call their own.</p>

<p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.realtyhop.com/for-sale/san-diego-ca#affordability-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by real estate listing platform RealtyHop, which examined home affordability for the average American family in the 100 largest U.S. cities and their surrounding metros.</p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>Based on this report’s key findings, Carlsbad is the least affordable housing market in the regional metro area. RealtyHop says households in Carlsbad spend 69.03% of their income on mortgage and property tax payments.</p>
<p>Next in line as least affordable comes Escondido, where homeowners spend 65.64% of their income on housing costs annually, this report shows.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab">
</aside>
<p>Then comes San Diego as the third least affordable city in the region, with homeowners spending 57.31% of their income and Oceanside in fourth place with residents dishing out 55.78% of their yearly earnings, according to RealtyHop.</p>
<p>The most affordable San Diego metro area city is Chula Vista, where homeowners spend 48.26% of their earned money for the year. This South Bay community also has the lowest median purchase price for a home at $725,000, the report shows. </p>

<p>SAN DIEGO — A search and rescue effort for an elderly man on a trail in Rancho Bernardo Wednesday ended as a recovery effort. San Diego Fire officials say the man in his 80s appears to have died from heat-related issues.</p>
<p>“It’s sad for us to see anybody perish because of something that was preventable,” said Battalion Chief Michael Howell with the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department.</p>
<p>Howell said the temperature was in the 90s and humidity was at about 35% during the search, which is hard for people to acclimate to. </p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>Police told FOX 5 the man went out on a routine hike around 10:30 a.m. When he didn’t return after three hours, his wife reported him missing. The man was found around 2:30 p.m. about one mile into his hike, off the trail in some nearby brush.</p>

		New affordable housing opens in North County	</a><br />
</aside>
</div>
<p>“Disoriented and stress would point to, especially someone who does that every day on the same trail, then we have a medical emergency and they’re not where they normally are,” Howell said.</p>
<p>Casa de las Campanas, a nearby continuing care retirement community, confirmed the man lived there. Though different levels of care are offered, he was an independent resident and required no monitoring.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab">
</aside>
<p>Casa’s Executive Director Kim Dominy also said in a statement to FOX 5, “Our heartfelt condolences and thoughts are with the resident’s family, and we will do all we can to offer support to them at this sad time.”</p>
<p>Experienced or not, fire officials are urging people to take caution exercising in the heat. They say to hydrate, stick to early morning or late evening, have a working cell phone and partner with you if possible.</p>
