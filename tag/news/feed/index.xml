<p>SAN DIEGO — A freeway crash near the U.S.-Mexico border left at least one person dead Wednesday afternoon, the California Highway Patrol said.</p>
<p>The crash happened shortly before noon on southbound Interstate 805 near Camino De La Plaza, which is the last U.S. exit.</p>
<p>According to CHP’s Traffic Incident Information Page, a witness reported seeing a white sedan heading towards the port of entry make a U-turn on the freeway then hit a Honda minivan.</p>
<p>CHP confirmed that the driver of the white vehicle, an Audi, was driving the wrong-way at the time of the crash, hitting the van head on.</p>
<p>“Our understanding at this point is they turned around at the point of entry and came the wrong way,” CHP Sgt. Hope Maxson said.</p>
<p>It appeared the driver may have missed the last U.S. exit, and began driving the wrong way on I-805.</p>

<p>A Sig Alert was issued by Caltrans for the right two lanes on southbound I-805 north of Camino De La Plaza. The closure was expected to last several hours, according to CHP.</p>
<p>A man driving the minivan was killed as a result of the crash. </p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>The driver of the Audi, a 29-year-old man, was transported to a nearby hospital with major, but not life-threatening injuries, CHP said.</p>

<p>The San Diego County Medical Examiner’s Office was called out to the scene of the crash.</p>
<p>Crews with San Diego Fire-Rescue Department and with the Cities of Chula Vista and National City were also on scene.</p>
<p>The incident is still under investigation and the identity of both men involved the crash have not yet been publicly released.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr3_ab">
</aside>
<p>Maxson added that drivers should be aware there is another option to turn back into the U.S.</p>
<p>“If you have missed the last U.S. exit here on the freeway, you can continue off to the left all the way down and there is a sign there that says U-turn back into U.S.A.,” Maxson said.</p>
<p>CHP also wants drivers to be aware of some ways to help protect yourself against wrong-way drivers. </p>
<p> “The safer place to be is normally the middle lanes because it tends to be that wrong-way drivers stick to the fast lane or the slow lane or the shoulders,” Maxson said. “The best thing to do is drive at a safe speed and keep a high visual horizon, looking as far down the freeway as you can.”</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO — Can you guess which San Diego metro area city has the most affordable housing market?</p>
<p>If you don’t want to spend over half of your yearly income towards homeownership, then San Diego may not be the place for you — hypothetically speaking. </p>
<p>Based on the average projected income of a household, median asking price, estimated mortgage cost and taxes, there’s only one San Diego metro area city where homebuyers will be forking out less than 50% of their income for a place to call their own.</p>

<p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.realtyhop.com/for-sale/san-diego-ca#affordability-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by real estate listing platform RealtyHop, which examined home affordability for the average American family in the 100 largest U.S. cities and their surrounding metros.</p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>Based on this report’s key findings, Carlsbad is the least affordable housing market in the regional metro area. RealtyHop says households in Carlsbad spend 69.03% of their income on mortgage and property tax payments.</p>
<p>Next in line as least affordable comes Escondido, where homeowners spend 65.64% of their income on housing costs annually, this report shows.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab">
</aside>
<p>Then comes San Diego as the third least affordable city in the region, with homeowners spending 57.31% of their income and Oceanside in fourth place with residents dishing out 55.78% of their yearly earnings, according to RealtyHop.</p>
<p>The most affordable San Diego metro area city is Chula Vista, where homeowners spend 48.26% of their earned money for the year. This South Bay community also has the lowest median purchase price for a home at $725,000, the report shows. </p>

<p>“We immediately fell in love with the location, the community, and the people. But changing the name of an old establishment, in an even older building, didn’t feel right. So, we decided to keep it. Yes, An’s Dry Cleaning is a nod to the previous establishment, but also a reminder that some things are better left unchanged,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/adcgelato/about_details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company said on its Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>The ice cream shop says it prides itself making gelato from scratch and combining quality ingredients with uncompromising processes to craft fresh and well-balanced gelato.</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO — A search and rescue effort for an elderly man on a trail in Rancho Bernardo Wednesday ended as a recovery effort. San Diego Fire officials say the man in his 80s appears to have died from heat-related issues.</p>
<p>“It’s sad for us to see anybody perish because of something that was preventable,” said Battalion Chief Michael Howell with the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department.</p>
<p>Howell said the temperature was in the 90s and humidity was at about 35% during the search, which is hard for people to acclimate to. </p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>Police told FOX 5 the man went out on a routine hike around 10:30 a.m. When he didn’t return after three hours, his wife reported him missing. The man was found around 2:30 p.m. about one mile into his hike, off the trail in some nearby brush.</p>

</aside>
</div>
<p>“Disoriented and stress would point to, especially someone who does that every day on the same trail, then we have a medical emergency and they’re not where they normally are,” Howell said.</p>
<p>Casa de las Campanas, a nearby continuing care retirement community, confirmed the man lived there. Though different levels of care are offered, he was an independent resident and required no monitoring.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab">
</aside>
<p>Casa’s Executive Director Kim Dominy also said in a statement to FOX 5, “Our heartfelt condolences and thoughts are with the resident’s family, and we will do all we can to offer support to them at this sad time.”</p>
<p>Experienced or not, fire officials are urging people to take caution exercising in the heat. They say to hydrate, stick to early morning or late evening, have a working cell phone and partner with you if possible.</p>

<p>CHULA VISTA, Calif. — A woman in the South Bay received an envelope that contained a mysterious powder this week. She reached out to local police who confirmed that the substance found was an illegal drug. </p>
<p>According to the Chula Vista Police Department, it’s not a trend yet but it’s a known drug dealing tactic: using someone else’s name and address to send illicit drugs. In this case, it impacted a small business owner, wife, and mom of four.</p>
<p>Ring camera video in one family-friendly Chula Vista neighborhood captured the moments one USPS employee dropped off what appeared to be an ordinary envelope at first glance for resident Graciela Arangure. </p>

<p>Upon opening it, she said, “I kind of felt it and I was like okay, it could be three or four random latex balloons in here.”</p>
<p>That would be common, given she runs a home-based party decoration business called Creations by Chelyz. However, what was inside was anything but. </p>
<p>“I saw this black Ziploc bag that was thinly bubble wrapped and I’m like okay, that’s weird,” Arangure explained.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab">
</aside>
<p>It wasn’t balloons inside, but rather three small packets of a suspicious white powdery substance believed to be a drug. </p>
<p>Arangure later realized the envelope carrying the substance stated “return to sender” with her business name stamped as the sender, as if she had shipped it out. </p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>“If somebody is sending something out and they don’t have to put their own name on it, it now creates some distance from the actual person involved in the crime,” explained Sgt. Anthony Molina with CVPD. </p>
<p>After seeing the suspicious substance, Arangure quickly contacted police who arrived that night to investigate the package. </p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr2_ab">
</aside>
<p>“They were going back and forth, asking themselves, ‘is it cocaine?’ Then the other cop said ‘no, this is fentanyl,&#8217;” she said.</p>
<p>Police have yet to confirm that officially. </p>
